# MCP Integration in McpIDE

This document outlines the planned integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in McpIDE.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables seamless communication between development environments like McpIDE and AI assistants, allowing the AI to understand your codebase and provide intelligent assistance.

MCP follows a client-server architecture:
- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop or IDEs that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol

## McpIDE as an MCP Server

McpIDE will function as an MCP server, exposing the following capabilities:

### 1. Resources

McpIDE will expose various resources to AI assistants:

- **Codebase Files**: Source code, configuration files, and documentation
- **Project Structure**: Directory structure and file relationships
- **Metadata**: Project configuration, dependencies, and settings

### 2. Tools

McpIDE will implement tools that AI assistants can invoke:

- **Code Analysis**: Syntax checking, linting, and static analysis
- **Code Generation**: Creating new files, functions, or classes
- **Refactoring**: Renaming, extracting, and restructuring code
- **Documentation**: Generating documentation from code comments
- **Search**: Finding code patterns or functionality

### 3. Prompts

McpIDE will provide pre-defined prompts for common development tasks:

- **Code Review**: Analyzing code for issues and improvements
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving bugs
- **Feature Implementation**: Adding new functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving code efficiency

## Integration Architecture

The MCP integration in McpIDE will follow this architecture:

1. **MCP Server Module**: Core implementation of the MCP server capabilities
2. **Resource Providers**: Components that expose different types of resources
3. **Tool Implementations**: Modules that implement various tools
4. **AI Assistant Panel**: UI for interacting with AI assistants
5. **Settings Management**: Configuration for MCP capabilities

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure**
   - Implement MCP server core
   - Add basic resource exposure for files
   - Create simple tool implementations

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities**
   - Add more advanced tools
   - Implement comprehensive resource providers
   - Create pre-defined prompts

3. **Phase 3: UI Integration**
   - Develop AI assistant panel
   - Add configuration UI for MCP settings
   - Create visualization for available resources and tools

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Implement AI-assisted code completion
   - Add natural language code search
   - Create project analysis and insights

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Implement proper authorization for resource access
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive information is not exposed
- **Tool Validation**: Validate all tool inputs and outputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of resource-intensive operations

## User Experience

The MCP integration in McpIDE will provide a seamless experience:

1. **Transparent Context**: Users can see what context is available to AI assistants
2. **Tool Control**: Users can enable/disable specific tools
3. **Interaction History**: View and manage past interactions
4. **Customization**: Configure how AI assistants interact with the codebase

## Future Possibilities

- **Collaborative AI**: Multiple AI assistants with different specializations
- **Learning from Interactions**: Improving suggestions based on user feedback
- **Custom Tool Creation**: User-defined tools for specific workflows
- **Integration with External Services**: Connecting to issue trackers, CI/CD pipelines, etc.
