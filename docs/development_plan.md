# Development Plan for McpIDE

This document outlines the iterative development plan for McpIDE, a VS Code-inspired IDE with integrated support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and other productivity tools for software engineers and knowledge workers.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture and UI Framework

- [ ] Design modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Implement application settings with local storage
- [ ] Create theme system with dark/light mode support
- [ ] Design main window layout with docking support
- [ ] Implement split view editor container
- [ ] Create file explorer with basic functionality

## Phase 2: Editor Features

- [ ] Implement code editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add line numbers and gutter support
- [ ] Implement text editing features (indentation, selection, etc.)
- [ ] Add search and replace functionality
- [ ] Implement cursor position tracking
- [ ] Create status bar with editor information

## Phase 3: File and Workspace Management

- [ ] Implement file operations (create, open, save, delete)
- [ ] Add workspace management
- [ ] Create recent workspaces functionality
- [ ] Implement session persistence
- [ ] Add project-wide search
- [ ] Create file type associations

## Phase 4: Terminal and Tools Integration

- [ ] Implement integrated terminal
- [ ] Add task running capabilities
- [ ] Create output panel for build results
- [ ] Implement problems panel for errors and warnings
- [ ] Add debug console
- [ ] Create extensions framework

## Phase 5: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

- [x] Research Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture and capabilities
- [ ] Implement basic MCP server infrastructure
- [ ] Add resource exposure for codebase files
- [ ] Implement MCP tools for code operations
- [ ] Create AI assistant integration panel
- [ ] Add MCP configuration UI

## Phase 6: Advanced AI Features

- [ ] Implement AI-assisted code completion
- [ ] Add code explanation and documentation generation
- [ ] Create refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Implement natural language code search
- [ ] Add project analysis and insights
- [ ] Create AI pair programming features

## Phase 7: Productivity Enhancements

- [ ] Add code snippets management
- [ ] Implement project templates
- [ ] Create task management integration
- [ ] Add version control system integration
- [ ] Implement collaborative editing features
- [ ] Create plugin system for third-party extensions

## Implementation Approach

For each phase:
1. Design the architecture and components
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add UI elements and user interaction
4. Test and refine
5. Document features and usage

## Current Focus

We are currently focusing on Phase 1: Core Architecture and UI Framework, specifically:
- Implementing the split view editor container
- Creating the main window layout
- Setting up the theme system
